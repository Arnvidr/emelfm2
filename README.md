emelFM2 is a file manager that implements the popular two-pane design. It features a simple Gtk interface, a flexible filetyping scheme, and a built-in command line for executing commands without opening a terminal-emulator application. It's designed to be small, and as fast as possible.

emelFM2 requires Gtk+2.6 or later. Gtk+3.x is ok, though problem(s) (notably aspects of the UI layout) may become apparent. It's too soon to comment about Gtk+4.
