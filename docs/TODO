$Id: TODO 1414 2009-02-01 22:09:35Z tpgww $
This file is part of emelFM2.

Here is a list of things left TODO so nobody will forget them.
(see also http://emelfm2.net/TODO, which may sometimes be more recent than this file)

=== tasks that always apply ===
 * update documentation and homepage/wiki/on-line user guide
 * find solutions for FIXMEs in the code
 * find & fix memory leaks
 * additional translations (ja, fr, de, ru, pl exist now) Volunteers welcome !

=== probable changes ===
 * code restucturing and clean up

=== worth considering ===
 * support regular expressions in rename-plugin
 * use libmagic directly, instead of shell 'file' command
 * update tracker-plugin as tracker's API matures
 * provide atk/gail assistive-technology support in all relevant places
 * plugin-based support for general namepaces, not limited to root of the mounted filesystem, e.g. archives, remote filesystems (via gio/gvfs/libferris etc), collected items (probably tagged), chroot

=== low priority things that can be done when there's time and interest ===
 * add missing API documentation
 * complete documentation about action arguments
 * support non-english-ascii letters (replacing dDfFpP etc) in macros
 * find a way to have those small lines in the treeview as kde/qt or windows provide them
 * add tooltips to context menus where now missing
 * find a way to tap into shell's completion process, to enhance command-line tab completion (not directly possible with bash)
 * support theming for custom icons

=== changes that may not be worth the effort ===
 * interrogate shared-configuration data for more filetype handlers (but FDO spec is still too immature)
 * strictly incremental update of displayed filelists (if a reliable change-monitor ever becomes readily and widely available ...)
 * show filetype/dir icons in file lists
 * undo, for completed file operations (needs lots more cacheing of information about processed items and anything affected by the operation)
 * custom formatting of hyperlinks displayed in the output pane
