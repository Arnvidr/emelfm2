DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~
emelFM2 is a file manager that implements the popular two-pane
design. It features a simple GTK+2 interface, a flexible filetyping
scheme, and a built-in command line for executing commands
without opening an xterm.

HELP
~~~~
Your help is wanted! It is always nice to get bug reports, comments,
feature requests or patches. There is an emelFM2 wiki where some
contents needs to be added. If you have any programming skills,
you might also want to take a look at the TODO list.

Please send bug reports, comments or feature requests to the mailing
list (see above). You do not need to be a subscriber to the list.

INTERNATIONALISATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
i18n support is almost complete. Within the codebase, virtually all
strings to be translated have the necessary _() or N_() tags. There
are a few for which a final decision on whether to translate has not
yet been made.

So if you don't mind possibly making some relatively minor changes
later, feel free to do a translation. Start by asking on the mailing list
if anybody else is already doing the same. The make targets are
i18n and [un]install_i18n.

The help documents USAGE and CONFIGURATION might well be
translated at some future time, but they are not yet mature.
Probably not worth translating yet.

COMPILATION, INSTALLATION, UNINSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See the INSTALL file.

This version of emelFM2 requires Gtk+2.6 or later.
