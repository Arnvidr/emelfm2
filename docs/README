DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~
emelFM2 is a file manager that implements the popular two-pane
design. It features a simple GTK interface, a flexible filetyping
scheme, and a built-in command line for executing commands without
opening a terminal-emulator application. It's designed to be small,
and as fast as possible.

emelFM2 requires Gtk+2.6 or later. Gtk+3.x is ok, though problem(s)
(notably aspects of the UI layout) may become apparent. It's too
soon to comment about Gtk+4.

HELP
~~~~
Your help is wanted! It is always nice to get bug reports, comments,
feature requests or patches. There is a wiki where some content needs
to be added. If you have any programming skills, you might also want
to take a look at the TODO list.

Please send bug reports, comments or feature requests to the mailing
list (see above). You do not need to be a subscriber to the list.

INTERNATIONALISATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the codebase, all strings to be translated have the necessary
_() or N_() tags.

Translations exist for
 * japanese
 * simplified chinese
 * french
 * german
 * russian
 * polish

Feel free to do another language. Start by asking on the mailing
list if anybody else is already doing the same. The 'make' targets are
i18n and [un]install_i18n.

The help documents USAGE and CONFIGURATION might well be translated
at some future time, but they are not yet mature.
Probably not worth translating yet.
