DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~
emelFM2 is a file manager that implements the popular two-pane design.
It features a simple Gtk interface, a flexible filetyping scheme, and
capacity for executing commands without opening a terminal-emulator
application. It's designed to be small, and as fast as possible.
For users so inclined, it's extensively customizable.

emelFM2 works on Gtk from 2.6 to 3.22.
Some aspects of the design of Gtk3 and/or Gtk3 themes are 'unfriendly'
(not only to emelFM2).

list (see above). You need to be a subscriber to the list.

Feel free to do another language. Start by asking on the mailing list
